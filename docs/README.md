Task Engine is a Matlab framework for Psychology/Neuroscience stimulus presentation and data acquisition. It is built on top of [Psychtoolbox](https://http://psychtoolbox.org/). 

### What Task Engine does:

- Runs large, complex task batteries
- Acquires trial log data (conditions, responses etc.) and eye tracking data
- Handles basic online area-of-interest (AOI) for eye tracking studies. 
- Provides a framework for sending event markers to other devices (EEG, NIRS, etc.)
- Harmonises visual stimulus drawing across varying monitor sizes and resolutions
- Provides online feedback to experimenters, allowing non-experts to collect standardised data in multi-site projects and clinical trials
